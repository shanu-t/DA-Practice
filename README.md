**I have been practicing data analysis by working on various datasets, focusing on cleaning, exploring, and drawing insights from data using tools like [pandas,numpy and matplotlib ]. 
My process usually follows a structured approach, starting from data collection to building meaningful visualizations**

**My process**
1:- Data Collection — Where and how you got the data.

2:- Data Cleaning — How you handled missing values, duplicates, or outliers.

3:- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — How you explored patterns, trends, correlations.

4:- Visualization — How you presented findings visually.

"In my data analysis practice, I mainly work with structured sales data from an online retailer. I use Python — primarily pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for visualization. My workflow starts with gathering the data, cleaning missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent formats.

Then, I perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), identifying trends like seasonal spikes in sales or customer buying patterns. I often use pivot tables in Excel or dashboards in Power BI to summarize the data for stakeholders.

One project I loved was analyzing customer churn, where I discovered that customers who interacted with customer support twice within a month were 30% less likely to churn. This insight helped suggest changes to the support strategy.

Challenges I faced included dealing with extremely large datasets, but I learned to optimize my queries and use sampling techniques. This made my analysis faster and more efficient."
